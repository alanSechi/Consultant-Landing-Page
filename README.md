How i made it

Using Trello for organize tasks, i have split the website in 9 specified sections:

    Landing homepage
        This is the homepage, here you can find a simply background with the navbar and the button "get started".
    Services section
        Here you can find all the services, when you mouse-hover a service, a little animation appear.
    People section
        Here you can read about people, they are in quick turnaround!
    Video section
        This is a simple video tag with a personalized placeholder
    Q&A section
        Here you can find all the users's FAQ. In this section, i've use JavaScript for the accordion menu and the "Load more" button (that loads more questions).
    Features section
        In this section you can find all the best features you can have, by getting a permit!
    Reviews section
        In this section you'll find the users's reviews. I've use JavaScript arrays for building the slider, that change from one two other review. One array for names, one for the avatars, one for the review contents and one for the user ratings!
    Login section
        In this section you can find a login form, where you can insert your name, and your password. For this form, with JavaScript, i've handled the errors and check the password validation, when you start to write your password a little box will appear saying what is missing in the checks.
    Footer Section
        Here you can find the stuff that always goes in the footer section smile


        And last not least, using a 767.98px CSS breakpoint (Iphone X breakpoint), i've done the mobile website version too. 
        In this case, i've use Javascript to handle the navigation bar.
